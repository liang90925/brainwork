869. Find the Derangement of An Array
中文English
In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

There's originally an array consisting of n integers from 1 to n in ascending order, you need to find the number of derangement it can generate.

Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 10^9 + 7.

Example
Example 1:

Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
  The original array is [1,2,3]. 
  The two derangements are [2,3,1] and [3,1,2].
Example 2:

Input: 2
Output: 1
Notice
n is in the range of [1, 10^6][1,10
​6
​​ ].
