410. Split Array Largest Sum  https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/

Difficulty: Hard
Contributors: Admin
Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.

Note:
Given m satisfies the following constraint: 1 ≤ m ≤ length(nums) ≤ 14,000.

Examples:

Input:
nums = [7,2,5,10,8]
m = 2

Output:
18

Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
