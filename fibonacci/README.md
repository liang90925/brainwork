In the Fibonacci integer sequence, F0 = 0, F1 = 1, and Fn = Fn − 1 + Fn − 2 for n ≥ 2. For example, the first ten terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,…
An alternative formula for the Fibonacci sequence is:

Given an integer n, your goal is to compute the last 4 digits of Fn

1.0 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000,000
