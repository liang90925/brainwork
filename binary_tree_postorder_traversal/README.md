145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal  QuestionEditorial Solution  My Submissions

Difficulty: Hard
Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [3,2,1].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

(not good because it changed the structure of the TreeNode)

(didn't change the structure, which is good, but hard to understand)
