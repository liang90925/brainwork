// similar to 3sum, 4sum has three levels of for/while loop;
// loop through to select a first element;
// loop through to select the second element;
// and then loop through the rest for other two elements just like 2sum
// two things need to be taken care;
// 1. sort the input nums
// 2. take care of the duplicate numbers (skip them)
