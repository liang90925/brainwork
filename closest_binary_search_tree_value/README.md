中文English
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Example
Example1

Input: root = {5,4,9,2,#,8,10} and target = 6.124780
Output: 5
Explanation：
Binary tree {5,4,9,2,#,8,10},  denote the following structure:
        5
       / \
     4    9
    /    / \
   2    8  10
Example2

Input: root = {3,2,4,1} and target = 4.142857
Output: 4
Explanation：
Binary tree {3,2,4,1},  denote the following structure:
     3
    / \
  2    4
 /
1
Notice
Given target value is a floating point.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.
