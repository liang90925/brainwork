101. Symmetric Tree   https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/

Difficulty: Easy
Contributors: Admin
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
Note:
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

refer to : http://fisherlei.blogspot.com/2013/01/leetcode-symmetric-tree.html for recursive
for non recursive, can also refer to http://www.cnblogs.com/springfor/p/3879595.html and http://blog.csdn.net/kenden23/article/details/19249357
but the current nonrecursive solution is also good
