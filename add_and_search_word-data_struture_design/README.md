Difficulty: Medium
Contributors: Admin
Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addWord(word)
bool search(word)
search(word) can search a literal word or a regular expression string containing only letters a-z or .. A . means it can represent any one letter.

For example:

addWord("bad")
addWord("dad")
addWord("mad")
search("pad") -> false
search("bad") -> true
search(".ad") -> true
search("b..") -> true
Note:
You may assume that all words are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
