Given a list of folders, remove all sub-folders in those folders and return in any order the folders after removing.

If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: / followed by one or more lowercase English letters. For example, /leetcode and /leetcode/problems are valid paths while an empty string and / are not.

 

Example 1:

Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.
Example 2:

Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d/" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".
Example 3:

Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 10^4
2 <= folder[i].length <= 100
folder[i] contains only lowercase letters and '/'
folder[i] always starts with character '/'
Each folder name is unique.

HINTS
Sort the folders lexicographically.
Insert the current element in an array and then loop until we get rid of all of their subfolders, repeat this until no element is left.
