As a follow up for Tiny URL, we are going to support custom tiny url, so that user can create their own tiny url. That is to say, you need to implement one more createCustom than 232. Tiny Url.

You should implement three methods:

longToShort(url) Convert a long url to a short url which starts with http://tiny.url/.
shortToLong(url) Convert a short url to a long url.
createCustom(url, key) Set the short url of a long url to http://tiny.url/ + key
You can design any shorten algorithm, the judge only cares about:

The length of short key' generated by longToShort should equal to 6 (without domain and slash). And the acceptable characters are [a-zA-Z0-9]. For example: abcD9E
No two long urls mapping to the same short url and no two short urls mapping to the same long url.
If createCustom can not meet users' expectment, return "error"; otherwise return the short url.
Have you met this question in a real interview?  
Example
Example 1:

Input:
  createCustom("http://www.lintcode.com/", "lccode")
  shortToLong("http://tiny.url/lccode")
  createCustom("http://www.lintcode.com/", "ltcode")
Output:
  "http://tiny.url/lccode"
  "http://www.lintcode.com/"
  "error"
Example 2:

Input:
  longToShort("http://www.lintcode.com/")
  createCustom("http://www.lintcode.com/", "ltcode")
Output:
  "http://tiny.url/abcdef"    => This answer is not unique.
  "error"
Explanation:
  Although it is almost impossible:
  if your longToShort() just returns "http://tiny.url/ltcode",  
  your createCustom() should return "http://tiny.url/ltcode".
