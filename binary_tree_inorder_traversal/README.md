94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal  QuestionEditorial Solution  My Submissions

Difficulty: Medium
Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree [1,null,2,3],
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [1,3,2].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
